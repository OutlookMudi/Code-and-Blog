This repository contains a javaScript program (apps.js) that converts a number to a string, 
the contents of which depends on the number’s prime factors.

* If the number contains `3` as a prime factor, output `"Pling"`. 
* If the number contains `5` as a prime factor, output `"Plang"`. 
* If the number contains `7` as a prime factor, output `"Plong"`. 
* If the number does not contain `3`, `5`, or `7` as a prime factor, 
just pass the number’s digits straight through. 

 Mochai and Chai tests are written for this program in appTest.js contained in the Test folder.
